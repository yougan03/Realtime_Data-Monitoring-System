# Realtime_Data-Monitoring-System
	This project is about to build a data acquisition system using an ARM controller to gather sensor data and display the information on an LCD.	I worked with sensors such as LDRs, temperature sensors, and real-time clocks (RTC), utilizing protocols such as SPI and I2C.
